  - heading: Absolute Tracking + Free Node
    text: "This scene contains an example of the using Absolute Tracking and also
      a free node.  In this scene, you have to be wearing and use the left forearm
      node as the light intensity controller.  By holding the node with the led facing
      you and pointing up. If you rotate the node in your hand in such a way that
      the LED points up, then points away from you, then down, then back to the original
      position, you will be controlling the light intensity on a Spot Light on the
      scene. \nBear in mind that the Axis Brain on this scene have a reference to
      a specific Configuration Asset (thats also on the scene folder). If you click
      on Axis Brain game object, you will notice that the node #7 (originally Left
      Forearm)is set to be a FreeNode. That means that it wont update the Mannequin
      Model and consequently, won't update the character. \nYou'll also notice the
      presence of a game object called Light Control. In that game object there is
      a simple script, with the same name, that subscribe to an Action and update
      the Spot Light intensity accordingly. Please, check the aforementioned objects
      to understand what is going on."

  - heading: Absolute Tracking + Node Object
    text: 'This scene contains an example of the usage of Axis System attached to
      physical objects. You don''t need to attach to anything, just need to hold
      the node in a specific way: open your right hand palm up, rest the node with
      the LED visible and the led oriented as your thumb. Close your hand and thats
      it.  There is a picture on the Scene folder with how to hold the node.

      In
      the scene your character will be holding an Flash Light. Move the node on your
      hand and observe the scene.'
