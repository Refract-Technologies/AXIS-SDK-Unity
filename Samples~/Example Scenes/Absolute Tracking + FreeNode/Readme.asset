  title: Axis Body Tracking
  sections:
  - heading: Axis Absolute Tracking + Node Object
    text: '
 
      This is a scene where one of the nodes is converted to a Free Node. A Free Node is when the node acts as somekind of input. 
	  It''s an experimental feature where you can use Axis Nodes while not attached to your body or any object. 
	  The idea behind this scene is to use one of the nodes as a light controller for the room.
      To make it work, you have to place the Left ForeArm node flat on a table, with
      the LED facing up and pointing away from you.


      Then you have to go to the Axis Control Center and perform the calibration, like you did before, but
      this time leave the node on the table. After running the calibration, come
      back to Unity and hit play.
 
  
      Thats it! If everything
      works as expected, you can rotate the node on the table and the room light will behave accordingly. Keep in mind, this is an experimental feature
      that is only here to spark your imagination!
	   
	   
	  To understand what is happening, there is two things to keep in mind: 
	   
	    
	  1) Check the game object LightControl. If you open the only script on this object you will find all the logic that make this works. It registers to the Action that''s called everytime
	  there is new data from Axis and then control the light based on the values on the selected Node Index.
	   
	    
	  2) The Axis Brain on this scene uses a custom configuration file, called: "Absolute Tracking + Free Node Configuration". If you open it, you will see that the Node 7 (which usually is the Left Forearm node) is configured to be a Free Node. If you change to the default configuration (Left Forearm),
	  the light control will still work, but the Forearm will be also updated!
