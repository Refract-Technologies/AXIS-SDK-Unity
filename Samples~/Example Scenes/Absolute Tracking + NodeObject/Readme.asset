  title: Axis Body Tracking
  sections:
  - heading: Axis Absolute Tracking + Node Object
    text: '
 
      This is a scene where one of the nodes is converted to a Node
      Object. A Node Object is an experimental feature where you can use Axis Nodes
      attached to objects. In this example, you don''t need to attach to anything,
      but the idea behind this scene is to use one of the nodes as a flashlight.
      To make it work, you have to place the Left ForeArm node flat on a table, with
      the LED facing up and pointing away from you.


      Then you have to go to
      the Axis Control Center and perform the calibration, like you did before, but
      this time leave the node on the table. After running the calibration, come
      back to unity and place you right hand palm facing up and put the node with
      the LED facing up and pointing to your fingers.
 
  
      Thats it! If everything
      works as expected, when you hit Play, you will be able to move around in the scene and the Node you are holding
      will behave like a flashlight. Keep in mind, this is an experimental feature
      that is only here to spark your imagination!
	   
	   
	  To understand what is happening, there is two things to keep in mind: 
	   
	    
	  1) Check the game object NodeObjectProcessor (it''s a child of Axis Brain). In the single script on this game object, there is a reference to a prefab called Flash Light. Inside that Prefab, there is a script called Node Object, and you will find some configurations there.
	   
	    
	  2) The Axis Brain on this scene uses a custom configuration file, called: "Absolute Tracking + Node Object Configuration". If you open it, you will see that the Node 7 (which usually is the Left Forearm node) is configured to be a NodeObject.
